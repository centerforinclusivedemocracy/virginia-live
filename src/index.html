            <p>
                The Voting Location Siting Tool aids election officials in the siting process by identifying optimal voting locations for half-mile grid squares across a county or city. Election officials are able to find specific locations for consideration in these areas using local knowledge of their county or city’s resources and needs. The Siting Tool also provides visualization of demographic and voter data at the community level. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: The Tool sites the number of voting locations in the most recent comparable election publicly disclosed by the county or city elections office. The Siting Tool’s purpose is to model the location of voting sites based on the number of sites that a county or city is required to provide, not to suggest what number of voting locations best serves a community.
